# Lombok Builder Helper

Displays an error when non-null fields have *not* been included in calls to a Lombok **@Builder**.

On error, this plugin will provide a quick-fix that will add all non-null fields to the builder call. 

The inspection settings can be modified in Settings | Editor | Inspections under the
name 'Lombok builder is missing non-null fields'

***Note: This plugin only works with the annotations provided by Lombok, Jetbrains and javax***
